<br>Hi, my name is Udochi Okeke and I am trying to learn to code by building 90 java projects in 6 months.
<br>Visit my GitHub account at <a href="www.github.com/neurogirl47">www.github.com/neurogirl47</a> to view all of my projects.
<br> Today I attempted to build an applet that would display on my web page.
<br> Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in completing it.
<br>However, I have uploaded the code under "Welcome Applet" on my GitHub account.
<br>If you are interested in following my journey to becoming a java developer, follow me on twitter <a href ="www.twitter.com/paxrivers">@paxrivers</a>
<br><embed code="org.applet.hello.WelcomeApplet"
	archive = "WelcomeAppletDemo.jar"
	width="200" height="200"
	type="application/x-java-applet;version=1.6"
	pluginspage="http://java.com/download"
	param name="permissions" value="sandbox"
/>

<br>See you next time! :-)
